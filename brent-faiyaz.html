weed, the pussy</u><br>The singer lists the things that he might be addicted to, including love, drugs, smoking weed, and having sex.</p><br><p><u>Maybe it's all the above, maybe I don't need a hug</u><br>He acknowledges that it could be a combination of all these things, and that even though he might need emotional support, maybe that's not what he really needs right now.</p><br><p><u>Maybe I'm just fucked up</u><br>The singer admits that he might have some personal issues that are causing him to struggle with addiction.</p><br><p><u>I wanna have more threesomes but you're so territorial</u><br>He expresses a desire to have more sexual experiences with multiple partners, but acknowledges that his partner is not comfortable with it.</p><br><p><u>I can't even kick it 'cause you watching my story though</u><br>He feels like he can't even hang out with friends because his partner is always checking up on him and monitoring his behavior.</p><br><p><u>I got ones you've seen and I've got some you don't need to know</u><br>He has some sexual experiences that he feels comfortable sharing with his partner, but there are others that he wants to keep private.</p><br><p><u>I done gave more dick than a little</u><br>He has had a lot of sexual experiences and partners.</p><br><p><u>I know I'm the reason that you freaky now</u><br>He takes credit for his partner's newfound adventurousness in the bedroom.</p><br><p><u>You wish you could be the reason that I settle down</u><br>His partner wants to be the one that makes him commit to a relationship, but he doesn't feel ready to do that yet.</p><br><p><u>You done gave me all I wanted but I still got reasons</u><br>Even though his partner has given him everything he could want from a relationship, he still feels the need to explore other options.</p><br><p><u>I should fuck around, I should fuck around</u><br>He is tempted to cheat on his partner and have more sexual experiences with other people.</p><br><p><u>I said, "A thot gon' be thot," so, I'm like, "Fuck these bitches"</u><br>He uses a derogatory term to refer to women who enjoy casual sex, and expresses a willingness to treat them poorly.</p><br><p><u>My son got a mother and I love her, so it's different</u><br>He acknowledges that he has a child with someone he cares about, and that he wouldn't want to treat that person in the same way as he treats others.</p><br><p><u>I'm here for one night, so, baby girl, what you sippin'?</u><br>He is only interested in casual hookups and doesn't want to form any real emotional connections with his partners.</p><br><p><u>I'm on some bullshit, my '94 Scottie Pippen</u><br>He's engaging in reckless behavior and comparing himself to a famous, controversial basketball player from the 90s.</p><br><p><u>So save the last dance is when I'm drunk and when I'm hittin'</u><br>He's only interested in hooking up when he's drunk and not thinking clearly.</p><br><p><u>Your boyfriend lame, that boy puss', that boy kitten</u><br>He insults a woman's boyfriend, suggesting that he's weak or effeminate.</p><br><p><u>It's me and my niggas, we lit and we wild</u><br>He is surrounded by friends who encourage his bad behavior.</p><br><p><u>Yeah, and we don't care how you feel inside</u><br>He and his friends are reckless and don't care about anyone else's feelings or well-being.</p><br><p><u>This is something like murder, no, it's genocide</u><br>He's engaging in self-destructive behavior that is harming himself and others around him.</p><br><p><u>You niggas livin' lies, this is civilized</u><br>He accuses others of being fake and dishonest, while he sees his own behavior as more honest or genuine.</p><br><p><u>Be careful who you judge and who you criticize</u><br>He cautions others not to judge him or his behavior without understanding his personal struggles.</p><br><p><u>It's hard bein' a people person, when they kill their minds</u><br>He struggles with connecting to others and forming meaningful relationships because many people engage in self-destructive behavior.</p><br><p><u>Hard times, sendin' cold chills down my spine</u><br>He's going through a difficult period in his life that is causing him anxiety and fear.</p><br><p><u>It's dark now, at sunrise, I was feelin' fine</u><br>He has been going through intense emotional ups and downs that are affecting his mental health.</p><br><p><u>Nothin' on my mind, I swear I didn't wanna die</u><br>He reflects on a point in his life when he was feeling overwhelmed and suicidal.</p><br><p><u>I'm outside on my grind, I don't believe in time</u><br>He is focusing on his work and career and doesn't want to be held back by time constraints.</p><br><p><u>All these haters clockin' me, these diamonds leave 'em blind</u><br>He is successful and wealthy, but feels like he's constantly being judged or scrutinized by others.</p><br><p><u>Jealousy and envy, I swear I'm readin' minds</u><br>He feels like others are envious of his success and are trying to bring him down.</p><br><p><u>Baby mama called, sayin', "Yeah, you actin' different"</u><br>He has a child with someone who is concerned about his behavior and how it's affecting their family.</p><br><p><u>All these drugs and these hoes got you fuckin' trippin'</u><br>His addiction to drugs and sex is causing him to act erratically and make poor decisions.</p><br><p><u>I made a million on the road, you'll be happy Christmas</u><br>He has become very successful in his career and is able to provide financially for his family.</p><br><p><u>Sayin' I would stay down but you know I didn't, yeah</u><br>He's acknowledging that he made promises to his partner that he wasn't able to keep, perhaps in regards to his addiction or infidelity.</p><br><p><u>Maybe it's all of the above</u><br>He reiterates that he is struggling with addiction and doesn't know which specific aspect of his lifestyle is the root cause.</p><br><p><span class=lyrics-text>Lyrics © CONCORD MUSIC PUBLISHING LLC, Royalty Network, Downtown Music Publishing<br>Written by: Christopher Brent Wood, Eliot Dubock, Jordan Ware,
