Pundits thought he had no chance, and newspapers gave him little coverage. Many felt a Southerner couldn’t win a national election, and he had no power base in Washington, where one establishment bigwig was overheard at a cocktail party saying, “He can’t be the President; I don’t even know him!” according to Carter biographer Kai Bird.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Yet when the Democratic Party presidential primaries were over, Carter came away with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=58483" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="a massive lead in delegates" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">a massive lead in delegates</a>, winning 2,239 compared to Wallace’s 57 and California Governor Jerry Brown’s 301. He decidedly captured his party’s nomination <strong></strong>on July 15, 1976.</p><h6 class="css-9e7625 e9ikml3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e9ikml1">Related Stories</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">How did he go from a long-shot dark horse to his party’s choice for presidential candidate? As is often the case with electoral victories, it was a combination of factors. Carter benefitted from hard work, a shrewd campaign strategy, and an electorate hungry for an outsider candidate following the Vietnam War and Watergate scandal. His victory also came during a time of new campaign finance laws and a revised primary election system that Carter and his team understood better than any of the other candidates.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“Carter benefitted immeasurably from the unique circumstances in the elections of 1976,” Peter Bourne wrote in his book Jimmy Carter: A Comprehensive Biography from Plains to Post-Presidency. “It is unlikely that he could have succeeded in any other year.”</p><h2 data-node-id=7 class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">An Early Start</h2><img alt='democratic presidential nominee jimmy carter working aboard the "peanut one" campaign airplane' title='Democratic Presidential Nominee Jimmy Carter Working aboard the "Peanut One" Campaign Airplane, photograph by Thomas J O&#39;Halloran' width=676 height=1024 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/democratic-presidential-nominee-jimmy-carter-working-aboard-news-photo-1677018442.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j1">Getty Images</span><p>Democratic Presidential Nominee Jimmy Carter works aboard the “Peanut One” campaign airplane in September 1976.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Carter’s presidential ambitions began far earlier than many people realized. He was sworn in as the 76th governor of Georgia in January 1971. But by as early as 1972, he was already trying to position himself as a possible vice presidential pick in that year’s national election, according to Kai Bird’s book <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.amazon.com/dp/0451495241 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Outlier: The Unfinished Presidency of Jimmy Carter" data-vars-ga-product-id=1ec6e58c-5f32-4ad3-9f0c-3099d9ec821d data-vars-ga-link-treatment="sale | (not set)" data-href=https://www.amazon.com/dp/0451495241 data-product-url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/0451495241 data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/0451495241 data-affiliate-network='{"id":"c754abb3-3204-4f94-a191-fe83f09385e4","site_id":"73ce8f33-abd8-4d76-b5c7-1c72caf717ce","metadata":{},"network":{"id":"469ce69f-4798-416d-9432-eaa9954b4053","name":"Amazon","metadata":{}}}' data-vars-ga-product-price=$12.69 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=5fda6368-ac3c-4c1d-9fc5-d1e2f9f11a28 class="body-link product-links css-9lyfaf e1rq56bv0">The Outlier: The Unfinished Presidency of Jimmy Carter</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After Republican candidate <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/richard-nixon data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Richard Nixon" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10"><u>Richard Nixon</u></a> trounced Democratic challenger George McGovern, Carter began having conversations with a small group of confidants about running in 1976. Bird wrote that after one such meeting, Gerald Rafshoon, who later became Carter’s White House communications director, commented: “That son of a b—, he wants it.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Hamilton Jordan, Carter’s longtime political operative and future White House chief of staff, wrote a 70-page memo laying out how Carter could win in 1976, even in a crowded field. By Christmas 1972, Carter was telling his family that he planned to run for president. His mother, Lillian Gordy Carter, skeptically responded, “President of what?,” according to Bird.</p><h2 data-node-id=12 class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">An Outsider’s Campaign</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Jordan stressed that voters would be craving an outsider candidate due to their disillusionment with government following the Vietnam War and Nixon’s Watergate scandal and subsequent resignation. Carter kept his distance from the Washington establishment, choosing Atlanta, rather than the nation’s capital, as his campaign headquarters, according to Bourne’s book.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Critics alleged that Carter avoided specifics on policy positions and instead ran on his life story and a populist, anti-establishment persona. He cultivated an image of honesty and integrity, promising voters: “I’ll never lie to you.” According to Bird, longtime advisor Charles Kirbo admonished Carter, only half-jokingly: “You’re going to lose the liar vote.”</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>Carter said he planned to run for president. His mother skeptically responded, “President of what?”<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">With few pundits taking him seriously at first, Carter traveled constantly and often slept on the couches of local supporters during campaign stops. According to Bourne, Carter rented a large hotel ballroom with enough food for hundreds of people during a campaign reception in Des Moines, Iowa, and only four people showed up. “I stood around embarrassed,” Carter said.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Lacking a national fundraising machinery like his opponents had, Carter had to “grub for every penny,” Bourne wrote. Members of his own family had to seek donations for him. His son Chip would literally stop people on the street and say: “My daddy is running for President, and would you give him $10?”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Carter also had to overcome biases against Southerners in national races, particularly from the Washington establishment. Bird wrote: “The accent grated on their ears. The image of the peanut farmer brought on a smirk. If he came from southern Georgia, [they thought] he must be conservative, and if Carter himself seemed intelligent … well, his entourage of rednecks were not so smart.”</p><h2 data-node-id=19 class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">A Winning Strategy</h2><img alt="jimmy carter standing in front of a bus and speaking into a microphone in front of a crowd of dozens of supporters and reporters" title="Democratic Presidential Nominee Jimmy Carter speaking to Crowd at Campaign Stop, Pittsburgh" width=1024 height=685 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/democratic-presidential-nominee-jimmy-carter-speaking-to-news-photo-1677018498.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j1">Getty Images</span><p>Jimmy Carter speaks to a crowd at a campaign stop in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1976.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">But the presidential election process underwent changes prior to 1976, and Carter and his team understood the potential of the new battleground better than his opponents. That year’s election saw a move away from old boss-dominated nominating systems and a larger number of primaries and caucuses.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Under one new rule, delegates in primary states were chosen by congressional district, with candidates who got 15 percent or more of the popular vote receiving a proportional amount of delegates, Bourne wrote. In the past, candidates could get by capturing a few big winner-take-all states, but Carter’s strategy focused on passing that 15 percent threshold in a large number of states and amassing delegates across all of them.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“Several candidates who would beat Carter in the popular vote would come away with fewer delegates from a state because they had not grasped the full significance of the new ‘democratized’ rules,”<strong></strong> Bourne wrote.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Carter also benefited from new legislation after Watergate that established public financing for presidential elections, Bourne said. Additionally, individual contributions were limited to $1,000, which benefitted the grassroots campaign of Carter, who did not have wealthy backers and depended largely on small amounts of money from ordinary citizens. “For the first time, dark horse candidates were competing on an equal footing with national figures,” Bourne wrote.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Just like Hamilton Jordan recommended in his 70-page memo four years earlier, Carter concentrated on achieving early wins in the Iowa caucus and New Hampshire primary.
