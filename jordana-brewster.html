And, rather than being killed off, his character was written out of the main storyline after his death in 2013. Now, with F9 about to hit theaters on June 25th, actor Jordana Brewster, who plays Brian’s partner Mia, has revealed how she paid tribute to her late co-star in the ninth chapter. Because the tribute is little and inconspicuous, you’ll have to pay close attention when watching the movie. Brewster revealed that she had bracelets produced for the film that pay homage to Walker in a discreet way. Brian, Olivia, and Jack’s names are engraved on the bracelets she wears as Mia.</p><p>She further revealed that after filming was completed, she retained the bracelets “as memories.” When asked about the original film’s director, Rob Cohen, saying that Walker had a crush on her in the early days, Brewster exclaimed, “Aww,” and stated that while she wasn’t conscious of it at the time, she had similar sentiments later. “From movie four to movie seven, I had a crush on him,” she admitted. “I never got to tell him that, but I believe he knew on many levels.”</p><h2>What is the Nationality of Jordana Brewster?</h2><p>Jordana Brewster was born on April 26, 1980, in the United States.
