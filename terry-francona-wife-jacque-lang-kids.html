coaching journey in the minor league with the Sarasota White Sox of the Gulf Coast League.</p><p>Similarly, he managed the Philadelphia Phillies (1997-2000) and later joined the Boston Red Sox (2004-2011) before taking his job at Cleveland Guardians in 2013.</p><p>Besides, the 2X World Series champion manager also worked as a third-base coach for the Detroit Tigers and bench coach for the Texas Rangers and Oakland Athletics.</p><h2>Wife Jacque Lang: Married Life And Four Kids</h2><p>Terry Francona and his ex-wife Jacque Lang tied the knot on January 9, 1982.
