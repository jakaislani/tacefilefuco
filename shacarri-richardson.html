Shayaria was a successful track and field runner, and at age 9, Sha’Carri found her mother’s medals from her high school running career. “My grandmother made [my mother] a big plaque full of medals, and I saw it one day and was like, ‘I want that.

In 2016, she gained national recognition as a sophomore at David W. Carter High School in Dallas when she became the Amateur Athletic Union Junior Olympics Champion in the 100 meters. In 2017, Richardson earned a bronze medal in the 200 meters at the USA Track and Field (USATF) National Junior Olympic Track and Field Championships.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Richardson committed to running at Louisiana State University in 2017. After graduating high school the following year, Richardson was the No. 1-ranked sprint recruit in the country.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">As a freshman at Louisiana State University, Richardson won her first NCAA title in 2019 and set a new collegiate record for the 100-meter dash, recording a time of 10.75 seconds. With a record under her belt, Richardson decided to withdraw from the university and set her sights even higher.

After crossing the finish line and running into the stands, she shared an emotional moment with her grandmother. “My grandmother is my heart.

She was subsequently banned from competition for one month and disqualified from competing at the Tokyo Olympics in August 2021. Richardson shared that her marijuana use occurred at the time of her biological mother’s death in June 2021 to help her cope with the loss.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“I want to take responsibility for my actions,” Richardson said <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nbcsports.com/olympics/news/shacarri-richardson-tests-positive-marijuana-olympic-100-meters data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="on the Today show" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">on the Today show</a>. “I know what I did.
