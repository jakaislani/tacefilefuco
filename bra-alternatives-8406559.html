Every lingerie department is filled with plenty of options, from adhesive bras and nipple covers to boob tape. That’s not to say you should throw out your traditional underwire bras, but different outfits may require you to have backup options for a more seamless look.&nbsp;<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Like with traditional bras, finding the right alternative can take a bit of experimenting. While some may have mastered the art of boob tape, others gravitate toward a simple bralette. Personal preferences, as well as a product’s features, can dictate the bra alternative you reach for. Not every style will give you the lift and support you need or a no-show appearance, depending on your chosen outfit.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">We tapped two undergarment experts to help us explain every bra alternative and their uses.

Mirand Koch says this is “a great comfort option” that’s perfect to wear when lounging around the house, traveling, or during pregnancy. You can layer your bralette under a T-shirt or maxi dress for a relaxed look, or they can also serve as a standalone top. Lewis shares that her customers wear bralettes this way when looking for “a touch of flair in their outfits for a night out.” While bralettes can provide maximum comfort and a stylish appearance, Lewis notes they “might involve less support for larger busts.” Their minimal support also makes them unsuitable for high-impact activities like jogging or hiking and may leave an outline if you’re wearing a fitted top.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-bandeaus></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Bandeaus</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Melodie Jeng/Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Bandeaus were an early aughts staple and are still a popular bra alternative for those looking for a no-show appearance. They have the same silhouette as a strapless bra but are made of stretchier fabric and feature two elastic bands for a more comfortable fit. Some bandeaus also include a built-in bra or cups for better support. Mirand Koch says some wear this style “underneath low cut/backless styles as their bra or over their strapless bra to conceal it.” For a bolder look, bandeaus can also be worn as a top underneath a blazer or paired with a maxi skirt. Lewis shares that bandeaus are favored for their “versatility, minimalistic design, and soft feel,” but she and Mirand Koch note that the style lacks support, especially for those with larger cup sizes.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-camisoles></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Camisoles</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Melodie Jeng/Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Similar to bandeaus, camisoles are extremely versatile and can be worn as a standalone top. Most feature spaghetti straps and a built-in shelf bra to offer a little bit of support, but they don’t include underwire or cups. Though camisoles are often worn by themselves, Lewis and Mirand Koch note that this alternative style is best for layering. Lewis recommends a camisole for additional coverage when wearing a sheer or low-cut top. Camisoles, especially form-fitting designs, can help create a seamless look and provide more torso coverage than a traditional bra. However, Mirand Koch says to keep in mind that “shelf bras within camisoles don't offer a lot of lifting and support” if you’re looking for an alternative with more structure.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-bodysuits></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Bodysuits</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Christian Vierig/Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Another option for a seamless look is a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>bodysuit</a>, which Lewis recommends wearing under fitted tops or dresses. Some bodysuits include shaping or double as shapewear for an even more streamlined appearance and better support. More casual options typically have double-layered fabric for moderate coverage but tend to lack structure and support for larger busts. Mirand Koch and Lewis also note that the fastener on bodysuits can be uncomfortable for some and make using the restroom difficult. But, if you love the ease of the style, throwing on a bodysuit and jeans for a night out is a no-fuss option and can be layered with a bralette or nipple covers if you need more coverage.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-sports-bras></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Sports Bras</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Edward Berthelot/Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For high-impact activities and workouts that require more support, Lewis suggests sports bras. Most sports bras are made of breathable and flexible material with a snug fit, so they will hold your bust in place but are also comfortable enough to lounge in. Mirand Koch also explains that there are two types of sports bras: compression and encapsulation. Compression styles lack structure and cup support because they compress your bust to your chest. Meanwhile, encapsulation sports bras have separate cups for better support and may feature underwire details. So, when shopping for a sports bra, choose the design that best suits your needs. If worn under a top, Mirand Koch also notes that sports bras can be bulky, so you may want to consider one made of lightweight fabric in this case.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-nipple-covers--pasties></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Nipple Covers & Pasties</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Edward Berthelot/Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Nipple covers and pasties provide zero support but are ideal for outfits where you only need minimal coverage. Mirand Koch says this alternative is “meant to be worn underneath form-fitting clothing and inside unlined bras and swimsuits to provide modesty (no headlights) and smoothing.” Lewis also recommends nipple covers or pasties for backless and sheer tops for added coverage. Of course, if you’re wearing more decorative styles, these are meant to be shown off with an open-cup bra. Most nipple covers and pasties are made of silicone, so they can be reused, but satin designs tend to be good for only one use. Lewis notes that you may also encounter adherence issues with this style, while Mirand Koch adds that pasties are not a great choice for those with larger busts as they aren’t very functional.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-boob-tape></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_46-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Boob Tape</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_47-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Raimonda Kulikauskiene/Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_48-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Unlike nipple covers and pasties, boob tape can provide a more natural look when worn under most garments. Lewis and Mirand Koch recommend reaching for this alternative when you can’t wear a traditional bra but need additional support, like with low-cut or backless tops and dresses. With boob tape, you can customize your coverage by cutting it into strips and applying it in a way that gives your bust a subtle lift. However, Mirand Koch notes that boob tape “takes some trial and error to figure out” and is only meant for specific occasions, not daily wear. Most boob tape also requires an adhesive backing, so Lewis adds you may experience some skin sensitivity or irritation during application or with removal.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-adhesive-bras></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_52-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Adhesive Bras</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_53-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Edward Berthelot/Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_54-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When a traditional strapless bra isn’t an option, an adhesive bra can be your quick fix. This style is backless and typically made of silicone material with an adhesive backing that will cling to your skin. Many are reusable and simply require a warm water rinse to restore the adhesive. According to Lewis, adhesive bras work best for strapless or backless outfits and are favored for their versatility and support. For those with larger busts, Mirand Koch does not recommend this style as “it will not lift or support you, nor will it cover larger nipples.”</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-faqs-2ec376cb-7396-43b1-99a0-9e57569ecf3c></span><h2 class=mntl-sc-block-universal-faq__title>Frequently Asked Questions</h2><ul id=mntl-sc-block-universal-faq__content_1-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block-universal-faq__content mntl-accordion js-accordion" readability=48.955470038483><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" data-ordinal=1 readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>How do you find your size in a bra alternative?</span></p><p>With bra alternatives, you can’t default to the size you wear for a traditional underwire bra. Lewis and Mirand Koch recommend referring to a brand’s size chart and comparing your bust and underbust measurements to their specific sizes, as every brand’s sizing methods are different. If you’re unsure about your measurements, Lewis notes that “some companies offer personalized in-store and virtual fittings, ensuring clients discover the perfect fit tailored to their measurements and preferences.”</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" data-ordinal=2 readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>How do you decide which bra alternative is right for you?</span></p><p>When shopping for a bra alternative, Mirand Koch explains that this decision is very “situational and preference-based,” so you’ll want to evaluate your needs. For instance, if you have a dress with a plunging neckline, you may reach for boob tape over nipple covers. Lewis also recommends determining the “level of support and comfort you require for different activities or outfits” and experimenting with “various alternatives to find what suits your body shape and personal preferences.”</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" data-ordinal=3 readability=-0.94532374100719><p><span class=accordion__title>What is the best bra alternative for daily wear?</span></p><p>If you’re looking for a bra alternative that is comfortable and versatile enough for daily wear, Lewis and Mirand Koch recommend bralettes or any wireless bra. “They provide a balance between support and ease, making them suitable for various activities,” says Lewis. She suggests the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Evelyn Bobbie Beyond Wireless Lift Bra</a> for maximum comfort and style for daily wear. Mirand Koch also notes that if you need an option with the best lift and support, try getting properly fitted for a traditional bra, as “you wear different styles for different occasions” and may want both wire and wireless options in your undergarment collection.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wauYZpmcqbKzusCtoK%2Bdo2KFdXyVbmxy</p></div><div id=links><a href=./david-ortizs-net-worth-biography-career-awards-fact-and-life-story.html>&#171;&nbsp;David Ortizs Net Worth, Biography, Career, Awards, Fact and Life Story</a>
