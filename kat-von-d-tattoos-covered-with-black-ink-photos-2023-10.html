Her mom tattooed it on her daughter's leg at a tattoo convention "in front of thousands of people" because it's her "fave word," Von D said.</li><li><strong>Oliver Peck portrait</strong>: Von D had a tattoo of her first husband at the top of her left thigh. They were married between 2003 and 2006.</li><li><strong>J:&nbsp;</strong>Von D's first tattoo was a thick letter J near her ankle.
