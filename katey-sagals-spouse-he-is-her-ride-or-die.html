Die</h1><div id=sub-header>June 2024 · 4 minute read</div><div class=entry-content><p>Katey Sagal’s spouse has changed thrice since she delved into the world of committed relationships.&nbsp;Fortunately, the talented actress seems to have gotten it right the third time, as her third attempt has lasted over 17 years.&nbsp;</p><p>The famous actress has had a long and successful career in television. However, she has not had as much luck in her love life.&nbsp;Sagal has married three times and has kids from two of those unions.</p><p>Keep reading to learn all we know about the talented woman and her spouse.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/sega.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_Katey_Sagals_Spouse></span>Who Is Katey Sagal’s Spouse?&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Katey Sagal is <a href=#>married</a> to actor, writer, and producer Kurt Sutter. Sutter is also an American screenwriter and is more famous for his work as a writer in hit television shows and movies.&nbsp;</p><p>A few of his credits include “Sons of Anarchy,” “The Shield,” and “Southpaw,” which was released on July 24, 2015, by The Weinstein Company. Sutter is also the creator and was a writer for the “Sons of Anarchy” spinoff, “Mayans MC.” He is known to work in different roles on his projects.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, on “The Shield,” he was a producer, writer, director and actor. He made his television debut as hitman Margos Dezerian. Sutter worked on the series with FX for years but was fired in October 2019. There were complaints of his “abrasive” and “unprofessional” behavior.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_Did_Katey_Sagal_Meet_Her_Spouse></span>How Did Katey Sagal Meet Her Spouse?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><a href=#>Katey Sagal and Kurt Sutter</a> met through a mutual friend. He asked for coffee with her sometime, and she agreed, but they did not immediately meet.&nbsp;At that point, Sagal was saddled with two young children, so she was a bit all over the place as a single mom.</p><p>She once phrased it as being “kind of out of touch.”&nbsp;As such, she only connected with Sutter sometime later. They met for coffee a few months after they were introduced.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/sagal.jpg><p>Even then, things were far from regular. According to reports, Sagal went to breakfast with Sutter with her sponsor in tow. She recovered from past substance issues and “didn’t trust” Sutter yet. Of course, he voiced his complaints.&nbsp;</p><p>Fortunately, by the end of their breakfast, the pair were inseparable. Sagal said, “We went and never left each other after that.” Their work relationship also evolved from there.&nbsp;</p><p>While she was on “Sons of Anarchy,” Sutter wrote her scenes, and they did not let the storyline come between them. Sagal and Sutter tied the knot in a private ceremony on October 2, 2004, at their home in Los Feliz, California. They welcomed their first child, Sagal’s third, Esme Louise, via a surrogate on January 10, 2007.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Katey_Sagals_Children></span>Katey Sagal’s Children&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Katey Sagal is mother to three kids, including a son, Jackson James White, and two daughters, Sarah Grace White and Esme Louise Sutter.&nbsp;Her first two are products of her second marriage. Esme is the only one she shares with Sutter, but he also loves the other two.&nbsp;</p><p>There were no plans for Esme to be born when Sutter married Sagal. He wanted no more kids, but that resolve weakened in the couple’s years together.&nbsp;Eventually, they started discussing expanding their family, but Sagal carrying the baby was not an option because of different factors.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/seggg.jpg><p>They ultimately chose to go the surrogate route, which led to the birth of their daughter, Esme.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_Katey_Sagals_Ex-Husband></span>Who Is Katey Sagal’s Ex-Husband?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The first time she tied the knot, Sagal did so with Freddie Beckmeier, a bassist best known for foundering the renowned funk band “The Beckmeier Brothers.”&nbsp;The marriage, held in 1977, was not destined for longevity. The two were divorced three years later.&nbsp;</p><p>Her second marriage was to drummer Jack White. He was a drummer for Ike and Tina Turner and singer Rick Springfield.&nbsp;He became Katey Sagal’s spouse in 1993, but they went their separate ways in 2000 due to irreconcilable differences. The first child they welcomed was a daughter named Ruby Jean.</p><p>She was born two years before their marriage but sadly passed away in October 1991. They <a href=#>welcomed</a> another daughter named Sarah Grace in August 1994. Then, in 1996, their son, Jackson James, was born.&nbsp;</p><p>Sagal is one of several Hollywood stars to have attempted marriage so many times before finding their preferred partner. Others like her include <a href=#>Kim Kardashian</a>, Angelina Jolie, and Jennifer Aniston.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kuKLAxLJkrJmXlrm0edKppq6rlWK1pnnIrGShnaJiv6qwxGamq2WUnrJw</p></div><div id=links><a href=./who-is-jonah-hill-see-net-worth-quote-awards-fact-wiki.html>&#171;&nbsp;Who is Jonah Hill?
