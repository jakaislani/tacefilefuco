his passion for cars.&nbsp;He is part of the Discovery Channel reality series&nbsp;</span><span>Off-the-Street</span><span>&nbsp;where he races with The Street Beast;&nbsp;a custom 1970 Chevrolet Monte Carlo with which he became one of the deadliest racers in the series, earning big reward money.</span></p><p><span>The Outlaws</span><span>&nbsp;show is what Doc has grown to be associated with over the years.&nbsp;His fans and anyone who has seen and heard of him have often wondered if he lived outside of street performance.&nbsp;We were initially clueless about it and decided to research it to be better informed and in turn educate others.&nbsp;Here we present everything we found out about “What does Street Outlaws Doc do for a living?”.&nbsp;But first, know its basics before you get popular with the TV show.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=basic-information-about-doc></span><strong><span>Basic information about Doc</span></strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><ul><li><span>He was born on February 19, 1969, in Moore, Oklahoma, and his name is James Love, the son of a concrete construction worker.</span></li><li><span>James was educated at Moore High School in Oklahoma.</span></li><li><span>From an early age, he had an interest in machines and how they worked, which influenced his decision to study machines at the Universal Technical Institute (UTI) in Scottsdale, Arizona.</span></li><li><span>Her first car, a Monte Carlo 77, her mother’s, was given to her so she could use it to pick up her younger brother and sister from school and walk to work.</span></li><li><span>Over time, he saved enough money to buy his first car, a newer model: the 72 Monte Carlo.&nbsp;It was fitted with a timing chain and rear brakes.</span></li><li><span>Many years have passed and the OK (Oklahoma) man’s interest in cars has continued to soar despite life’s challenges.</span></li><li><span>In April 1990, he got married to his sweetheart named Judy.</span></li><li><span>They have been together ever since and are parents to two daughters;&nbsp;Ashtyn and Haley.</span></li><li><span>This once poor child, who had a financially difficult childhood, has since used his passion for automobiles to transform his life forever.</span></li><li><span>Doc is one of the strongest hands on the wheels of&nbsp;</span><span>The Outlaws</span><span>&nbsp;show.&nbsp;His speed in races saw him well rewarded.&nbsp;The driver’s net worth, sources say, is over $500,000.</span></li></ul><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-does-doc-do-on-%e2%80%98street-outlaws-for-a-living-heres-what-we-know></span><strong><span>What does Doc do on ‘Street Outlaws’ for a living?&nbsp;Here’s what we know</span></strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>After graduating from UTI, the guy returned to Oklahoma with the joy of racing cars.&nbsp;He bought his first race car, a 1970 Chevrolet Monte Carlo from eBay in Wisconsin, and drove it back to Oklahoma.&nbsp;Doc christened his Chevrolet “The Street Beast” and started racing with it in earnest.</span></p><p><span>Along with his interest in racing, Doc was also an auto mechanic at a garage where he used his knowledge and training in machinery to repair and customize cars brought into the garage.&nbsp;In 2001, he started his own repair shop called Southwest Diesel Service with his grandfather.</span></p><p><span>Doc still harbored ambitions to dedicate more time to racing his Chevrolet, however, with this passion seeing him become part of an American reality series called&nbsp;</span><span>Off-the-Street</span><span>&nbsp;in the year 2013. He modified his Street Beast to provide the best performance on the race tracks, as well as its ability and control over the aerodynamics of the vehicle.&nbsp;He’s done very well doing what he loves the most and he can’t seem to stop his dominance over the race.</span></p><p><span>Coming to the question of what Doc does for a living, he has a lot to do in furthering his career and being a father to his family members.&nbsp;In the world of street racing and probably every other racing sport, drivers see it as a full time job and most don’t do anything else outside of training and racing.&nbsp;Most guys in&nbsp;</span><span>Off-the-Street</span><span>&nbsp;actually quit their full-time jobs, but that’s not the same for Doc.</span></p><p><span>He has a repair shop that he started with his grandfather several years ago and still works there because it’s something special for him and not just a business.&nbsp;So basically what he does for a living is he’s an&nbsp;</span><span>off-the-street</span><span>&nbsp;racing driver as well as an auto mechanic.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaK%2BYlsFusM6eqmacn5h6pbuMqKVmq6SnsqbAjKisraSRrMBuss6rZJplnJ7DqrrGZp%2BeqpWoeri0wK1ksJ1doLuww44%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./who-is-tabyron-rashad-smith-sentence-and-trial-update-omeretta-boyfriend-name.html>&#171;&nbsp;Who Is Tabyron Rashad Smith?
